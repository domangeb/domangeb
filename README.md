I am @domangeb, Fullstack engineer. I have 5 years' experience in a Belgian research center.
- I am specialised in Mobile development (Android SDK JAVA and Flutter Dart), desktop & Robot apps (C++) and backend (NodeJS, Express).
- I also have some experience with Python (Flask, pandas, OpenCV).
- I am confortable with both RDB (MySQL, SQLite) and NoSQL (MongoDB).
- I use Docker, Ansible and Nginx to deploy my server apps on the cloud.

I don't have any public repositery yet because all the apps I developed are the property of my company.
