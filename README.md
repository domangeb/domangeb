I’m @domangeb, Fullstack engineer.
- I am specialised in Mobile development (Android SDK JAVA and Flutter Dart), desktop apps (Qt C++) and backend (NodeJS, Express)
- I also have some experience with Python (Flask, pandas)
- I am confortable with both RDB (MySQL, SQLite) and NoSQL (MongoDB)

I don't have any public repositery yet because all the apps that I developed are the property of my company.
